#PROJECT TITLE : Air Realm
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/bGsJ078Rarg
#### Description: 
* This is a desktop application, it can run in any PC which have webcam, I developed this software with python.
* This application mainly focus on controlling the PC using dynamic hand gestures, which we developed using Opencv, Mediapipe, Pyatogui,CustomTkinter.
* firstly we developed a hand gesture recognition system using the Mediapipe hand module with the help of Opencv, so we can -recognize the Dynamic hand gestures based on time frame.
* Then we develop 4 featues with the hand gesture recignition, they are Mouse, movie, game, presentation.
* Mouse - This feature can control the functions and movements of the mouse, like right click, left click, double click, moving up and down, drag and drop.
* Movie - This feature can control the functions of the Media player while we watching videos, like pause and play, skip forward, skip backward, volume up and volume down.
* Game - It can control the functions of the racing games like move forward, backward,, turn left, turn right, break. This functions can be control just using a single hand.
* Presentation - its simple but effective feature, it can move the slides left and right based on your gesture,  while youre presenting at a certain distance.
* These are the features that i developed using those technologies.I have exported this software as  exe format, no need of installing the python and necessory packages.

* here im attaching the link of the exe file - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pv6Q7SkNoTLJDwpyvNwPSh8aArqtTeeu/view?usp=sharing
